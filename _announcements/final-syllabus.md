The syllabus for the finale examination will be the material covered in all the lectures on the course. The questions will be based on the topics
after linear algebra, but answering them will involve knowledge of the linear algebra in the course.

The topics on which questions will be asked and the sections in
`Apostol, Calculus Volume II (Second Edition, Wiley Reprint 2017)` or `M. Hirsch, S. Smale, R. L. Devaney, Differential Equations, Dynamical Systems, and an
          Introduction to Chaos, 2nd Edition, Academic Press, 2004.` which __roughly__ correspond to this material are as below.

* __Differential Calculus of vector fields:__: Apostol -  Chapter 8: Sections 8.1 - 8.22.
* __Applications of Differential calculus:__: Apostol - Chapter 9: Sections 9.9 - 9.15.
* __Multiple Integrals__: Apostol - Chapter 11: Sections 11.1 - 11.12 and 11.26 - 11.33.
* __Line Integrals__: Apostol - Chapter 10: Sections 10.1 - 10.16.
* __Green's theorem__: Apostol - Chapter 11: Sections 11.19 - 11.23.
* __Linear Ordinary Differential Equations__: Hirsch-Smale-Devaney: Chapter 2: 2-1 - 2.6, Chapter 3: 3.1 - 3.4, Chapter 4: Section 4.1.


The examination will be for 3 hours; 50% of the total marks of the course will be based on the final examination.
