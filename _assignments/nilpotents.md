1. Suppose $V$ is a vector space over any field with $dim(V) = 2$ and $L$ is a linear transformation such that $L^2 = 0$ but $L \\neq 0$. Let $v \\in V$ be a vector such that $L(v) \\neq 0$.
    1. Show that $v$ and  $L(v)$ are independent. (__Hint:__ Consider a linear combination which is zero and apply $L$).
    2. It follows from the above that  $v$, $L(v)$ is a basis of $V$. Find the matrix of $L$ with respect to this basis.

2. Let $V = \\mathbb{R}^3$ and consider the linear transformation $L : V \\to V$ given by $L(x, y, z) = (0, 0, x)$.
    1. Show that $L \\neq 0$ and $L^2 = 0$.
    2. Find the  matrix of $L$ with respect to the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.

3. Let $V = \\mathbb{R}^5$ and consider the linear transformation $L : V \\to V$ given by $L(x\_1, x\_2, x\_3, x\_4, x\_5) = (0, x\_1, x\_2, 0, x\_4)$.
    1. Show that $L^2 \\neq 0$ and $L^3 = 0$.
    2. Find the  matrix of $L$ with respect to the standard basis  of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.
