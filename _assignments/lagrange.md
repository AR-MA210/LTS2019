Consider two rectangles with length $L$ and breadth $B$ placed one on top of the other to form a $L \times 2B$ rectangle. Consider a connected path joining the bottom left corner of the lower rectangle to the top right corner of the upper rectangle consisting of two line segments $l\_1$ and $l_2$, one in each rectangle and meeting at the common edge.

1. Let $\\theta\_1$ and $\\theta\_2$ be the angles made by $l\_1$ and $l\_2$ to the line perpendicular to the common edge. Then show that $B\\cdot(\\tan(\\theta\_1) + \\tan(\\theta\_2)) = L$.
2. If light travels along $l\_1$ and $l\_2$ at speeds $v\_1$ and $v\_2$, respectively, find the total time travelled $T(\\theta\_1, \\theta\_2)$ as a function of $\\theta\_1$ and $\\theta\_2$.
3. Show that the path (of the above form) along which the total time travelled is minimum satisfies _Snell's law_ $\\sin(\\theta\_1)/\\sin(\\theta\_2) = v\_1/v\_2$.
4. Consider all cuboids with length $L$ breadth $B$ and height $H$ with surface area $6$. Show that the cuboid with largest volume among these is the cube with unit side.
