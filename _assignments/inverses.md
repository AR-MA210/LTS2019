Fix $n > 0$ and let $V$ be the vector space of polynomials $p(x)$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ of degree at most $n$. Let $L: V \\to V$ be the linear tranformation $L(p) = \\frac{dp}{dx}$, i.e., $L$ maps a polynomial $p$ to its derivative $\\frac{dp}{dx}$.

1. Prove or disprove: $L$ is injective.
2. Prove or disprove: $L$ is surjective.
3. Either describe a left inverse for $L$ (and prove that it is a left inverse) or prove that $L$ has no left inverse.
4. Either describe a right inverse for $L$ (and prove it is a right inverse) or prove that $L$ has no right inverse.
