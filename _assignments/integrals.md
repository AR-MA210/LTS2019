1. Let $S$ be the unit disc in the plane, i.e., $S = \\{(x, y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\}$. Let $f(x, y) = e^{x^2 + y^2}$.
  - __(a)__ Express $\\int\_S f(x, y)dxdy$ in polar co-ordinates.
  - __(b)__ Compute this integral by expressing as an iterated integral.
2. Let $C$ be the unit circle traversed in the anti-clockwise direction. Compute the following line integrals along $C$.
  - __(a)__ $\\int\_C ydx + x dy$.
  - __(b)__ $\\int\_C ydx - x dy$.
  - __(c)__ $\\int\_C xdx + y dy$.
